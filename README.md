# Simple-Portfolio-Calculator

You need an txt file as input, file name is [indices.txt].

Format for input is [rank indexA indexB].

You need to rank the indices from the newest date to the latest date with the newest data on the first line.

Blank lines after data need to be removed.

The [indices.txt] needs to be at the same folder as [SimplePortfolioCalculator.java] file.

OBS! Computer Resgion Format Setting is preferably to be [English (United States)] since under certain region setting computer would read "," instead of "." causing an InputMismatchException.

An [Indices.txt] is provided for testing and debuging purpose.
